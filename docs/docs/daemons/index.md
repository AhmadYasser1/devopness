title: Daemons
intro: Many applications rely on background processes, or daemons, to keep critical programs alive and running continuously. Devopness simplifies the management of these daemons by providing a centralized platform, allowing you to configure, monitor, and maintain these persistent processes with ease. Daemons run as background processes and can automatically restart a program if it fails or when its code/command line is modified.

## Daemon Actions
When managing daemons, you can perform actions like start, stop, and restart on specific servers. This allows for:

- **Targeted maintenance**: Restart a daemon on a single server without affecting others
- **Rolling updates**: Update daemons one server at a time for zero downtime
- **Troubleshooting**: Isolate issues to specific servers

See [Trigger Pipeline Action on Specific Servers](/docs/api/trigger-pipeline-action-specific-servers) for API usage examples.
