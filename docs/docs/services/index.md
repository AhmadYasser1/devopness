## Service Actions
When managing services, you can perform actions like start, stop, restart, and reload on specific servers. This allows for:

- **Targeted maintenance**: Restart a service on a single server without affecting others
- **Rolling updates**: Update services one server at a time for zero downtime
- **Troubleshooting**: Isolate issues to specific servers

See [Trigger Pipeline Action on Specific Servers](/docs/api/trigger-pipeline-action-specific-servers) for API usage examples.
